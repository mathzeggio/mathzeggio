# Hello, this is Matheus! 👋
Are you ready to meet a software developer with a knack for back-end magic? Look no further! I'm your go-to guy for all things server-side and behind-the-scenes.

Passion? Oh, I've got plenty! First, let's talk technology. It's like a never-ending adventure for me, navigating through lines of code, discovering new frameworks, and debugging like a detective on a caffeine high. I eat, sleep, and dream in code. Well, mostly because my code has a habit of waking me up in the middle of the night shouting, "It's not working!" But hey, that's the excitement of being a developer, right?

Now, let's switch gears to video games. Ah, the world of pixels, virtual quests, and epic battles. When I'm not crafting software, you'll find me immersed in virtual competitive game. It's a fantastic way to exercise my strategic thinking, problem-solving skills, and, let's be honest, my ability to resist the temptation of "just one more match."

Oh, and did I mention muscles? Yes, you read that right. I'm not just a keyboard warrior; I'm also a gymbro. There's nothing quite like the feeling of pumping iron, the satisfying clink of weights, and the pursuit of becoming a programming Hercules. Because, let's face it, debugging code and deadlifting share some similarities – it's all about strength, determination, and occasionally letting out a grunt of triumph when you conquer a particularly pesky bug.
